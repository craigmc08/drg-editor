To get started making mods, check out the [guides](/guides/readme.md). You
may want to begin by [adding a new weapon to a class](/guides/add-weapon.md).

## Downloading Dev Builds

If you want to try out the latest version of the editor before it's released,
a debug build is created for every commit. Follow Github's guide on downloading
workflow artifacts and grab `debug-build.zip` for the latest release:

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/downloading-workflow-artifacts

Note that this version may not be stable, may have partially implemented features,
and may not work properly. If you submit an issue for a dev build, you **must**
include the commit of the build the issue is for.

## Limitations

This tool is new and can't do everything, or even most things. There's many
assets from DRG that it can't even open yet.
